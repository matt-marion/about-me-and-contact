        <p>
          Hello! I'm a technical writer living in Brooklyn, NY. I've been working in this field professionally for over a year now. As a transplant from North Carolina, I spent the past year in the Research Triangle working as a technical writer with Biogen, a leading biotech and pharmaceutical company.
        </p>
        <p>
          My career started in 2019 when I decided to go to grad school for my master's degree. After learning about technical writing and researching the field, I enrolled in East Carolina University's MA in Technical Communications program. Two years later I graduated and moved to Raleigh to work for Biogen on a one-year contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          After my contract ended, I moved to the New York area with the hopes of continuing my career in a larger market and in a more vibrant city. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am transitioning my industry focus to tech. I've long admired the field of computer science and the infinite intracies found within. I've been teaching myself the basics of programming in preparation, starting with the html and css of this website.
